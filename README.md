# Train Schedule
https://tracypineda.github.io/train/

This project shows the most up-to-date train information and scheduling for the fictional "Train Schedule". Users have the ability to add information on a new train and can check the status of the existing trains on the site.

## Getting Started

Browse the site for existing train information. If you do not see a train and have updated information, please use in the "Add a Train" form below the "Current Train Schedule." When adding information on a new train, enter in the train ,name, destination, the time of the first train (in HH:mm military time), and the frequency in which it arrives (in minutes). The "Next Arrival" and "Minutes Away" fields will automatically be calculated after entering in the previous information. Enjoy!
